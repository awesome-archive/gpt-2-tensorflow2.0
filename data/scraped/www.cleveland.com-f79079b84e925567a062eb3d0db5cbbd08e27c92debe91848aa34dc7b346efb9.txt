COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Maybe it was the overnight snow. Maybe it was the noon start.

But whatever the reason, Ohio State had problems putting away Miami (Ohio) when they met on Saturday at Value City Arena.

A 14-2 run early in the second half didn't do the job on its own. But the Buckeyes finally claimed a 72-59 victory over the Redhawks, thanks to a 10-0 run.

Ohio State (11-4) led by as much as 17. But Miami (7-6) cut the deficit down to three with 6:03 left.

Keita Bates-Diop led all scorers with 19 points, nine rebounds and five blocks. C.J. Jackson added 16 points and six assists, and was 4-for-6 from 3. He hit a 3, then assisted on one to Kam Williams, who had 15, to help spark the 10-0 run.

Both teams shot the ball poorly at the start. Ohio State made just one of its first nine attempts from the floor. Both teams started 2-for-12.

Ohio State overcame a poor shooting start by getting to the free-throw line early and often, finishing 18-23 from there.

Jae'Sean Tate started, but was a game-time decision after suffering a left shoulder sprain in practice on Thursday. He finished with 11 points and five rebounds.

Darrian Ringo led Miami with 16 points, and Bam Bowman came off the bench to add 15.

When it was over

Miami cut the deficit to just three before Jackson hit a 3 with 5:34 to go. He drew an offensive foul and then fed Kam Williams in the corner for a 3, stretching Ohio State's lead out to nine.

It eventually became a 10-0 run, which helped the Buckeyes put away the Redhawks.

What it means

The game was a lot closer than the 13-point margin. But after having a five-game winning streak snapped vs. North Carolina on Dec. 23, Ohio State needed to get a win and some momentum going heading back into Big Ten play.

What's next

Ohio State starts a stretch where it plays four of its next six games on the road. The Buckeyes head to Iowa on Thursday at 7 p.m. ESPNU will broadcast the game.
