Just in time for the New Year, Aetherbyte Studios has released their new MSX2 game, Inferno.

Inferno is a platform action game in which the player must escape the pits of hell. As you progress, you upgrade from fists to various weapons by taking them from the devilish beasties that you kill. The game consists of four large maps to navigate, with additional puzzle elements in the form of gruesome flesh-and-bone doorways; some that are opened by defeating all the enemies on screen, others by locating the correct switch.

Currently, Inferno is available from their shop as a ROM file, but a physical version is promised to follow (theyâ€™ll even discount the physical version by the cost of the ROM if you buy it later).

You can purchase it from the Aetherbyte store here.
