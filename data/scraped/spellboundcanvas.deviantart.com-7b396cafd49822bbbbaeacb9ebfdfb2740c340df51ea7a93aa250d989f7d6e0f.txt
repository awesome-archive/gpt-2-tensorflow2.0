This is a massive collaboration that I did with . It was something that I was going to do last year on Christmas 2016, but the project was too big for me to handle on my own, so I brought in Berry to help me and we combined our skills to create a concoction of unprecedented cuteness. I did the sketches,lineart, and post editing. did the coloring, shading, and background.I would like to thank Berry for helping me with this project, It was fun and an honor working with him. With that being said I would like say Happy Hearth's Warming, Merry Christmas, Happy Haunakah, Happy Kwanzaa, see you all in 2018!
