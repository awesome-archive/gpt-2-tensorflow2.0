“Fake news” and “covfefe” are among the phrases that made it onto one university’s list of “banished words” this year.

Lake Superior State University released its 43rd annual “List of Words Banished from the Queen’s English for Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness” on Sunday, including the two phrases tied to President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP divided over impeachment trial strategy Official testifies that Bolton had 'one-on-one meeting' with Trump over Ukraine aid Louisiana governor wins re-election MORE.

Suggestions were sent to the school before voters were able to select their favorites.

Lake Superior State spokesman John Shibley told The Associated Press that it made sense for the list to include the political phrases, considering the political climate of the past year.

“It wasn’t as focused on politics in a very dirty sense,” he told the AP. “Most of the nominations were well thought through ... considering how the year was.”

Shibley said that “fake news” earned between 500 and 600 votes, but predicted that “covfefe” would be more of a fad word.

“Fake news” rose to prominence during Trump’s campaign, when he began using the phrase to attack stories critical of him. He has continued to use the phrase during his administration.

The phrase was also listed as the second-most annoying word of the year by Americans in a Marist poll earlier this month.

“Covfefe” rose to prominence after Trump tweeted the phrase from his account in an apparent typo earlier this year.
