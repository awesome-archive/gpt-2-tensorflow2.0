Highly-detailed and full of little accessories, the pieces put out by Hawthorne Village are adored and collected the world over, and when the company touts itself as being “the premier provider of heirloom quality miniature villages,” they’re not just blowing smoke up their own butts. They truly are just that, and their exceptional pieces are quite literally like small-scale worlds come to life.

Primarily known these days for their ever-expanding Christmas collection, which brings the warmth and joy of the holiday season into millions of homes, Hawthorne Village also specializes in officially-licensed villages based on iconic pop culture properties like STAR WARS and NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. And believe it or not, they once upon a time even delved pretty deep into the horror genre.

Beginning in 2004, Hawthorne Village began catering to the horror fan with the Village of Horror Classics Collection, a line of iconic horror movie locations that began with three locales based on the big three franchises: NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, FRIDAY THE 13TH, and THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE. The houses each included mini-figures of the corresponding horror icons, and the line soon expanded to included villages inspired by HALLOWEEN, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and even BRIDE OF CHUCKY.



Hawthorne’s horror collection, which was an official partnership with New Line Cinema, was available on a subscription-only basis, and each piece was sold for three installments of $19.98. How it worked was that you’d send out the money and receive a new house every other month, and it was FRIDAY THE 13TH’s “Camp Crystal Lake Cabin” that kicked off the whole thing in style. Individually hand-crafted and hand-painted, and equipped with hand-numbered certificates of authenticity, the light-up Village of Horrors pieces were produced in limited quantities and once they were gone, they were truly gone, which has resulted in all of them becoming quite rare, and very valuable, now over ten years later.

Not only is it very hard to find the pieces on eBay – at the time of writing this post, I see only four of them listed – but it’s no easy task to even so much as find pictures of each of the villages. And more than anything, that’s why I wanted to write up this post: so that there would be a place on the internet where you could check out all the horror movie locales released by Hawthorne Village, without doing any extensive digging of your own. You can thank me later. Or don’t. You don’t have to.

My research turned up a whopping 14 different Hawthorne Village of Horrors pieces, based on the six aforementioned franchises. So sit back, relax, and join me for a guided tour of those memorable horror movie locales!
