A kebab has become the world’s first to be sent to space.

Pascal Leuthold, a businessman, blasted the kofta 124,000ft through the sky on a weather balloon this week.

Witnesses in Zurich, Switzerland, saw the kebab soar into the air for an epic voyage through the stratosphere – and then crash back down to Earth some two hours later.

‘We thought what better way to announce our new chain to the world, than launching one of our kebabs into space,’ said the chef.

‘One of the most impressive things was to watch the Kebab freeze. We didn’t think about this before, but of course at this height it’s very cold and the whole kebab was frozen solid.

‘We are all very proud that we actually managed to pull this off – it took about three months to plan and film. What started as a bit of a joke actually turned into a really impressive event for us all.

‘Everyone has been commenting great things – we’ve have many great ideas planned and all of them of course will be centered around our kebabs.

‘It feels very cool to have launched the first kebab into space.’

The new restaurant is one of three establishments in Zurich part of the AYVERDI’S takeaway chain.
