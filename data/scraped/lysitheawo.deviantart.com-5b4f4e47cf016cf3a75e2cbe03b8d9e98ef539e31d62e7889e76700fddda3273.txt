Thanks a lot for your comment <33 I was a bit hesitant about making the orange light brighter but I thought there would be too much contrasts between the dark parts and I didn't want Jewel to be too much covered by lights since it would make the image seems less darker but also it would hide his shading.



Yes I really wanted to do something different this time ! I usually mainly focus on the character only but this time I wanted to work more on the background. I really enjoyed working on the lights !

And there will be definitely more art of Jewel coming soon :3 I want to make a bust turnaround and the age and expression memes with him ! I'm bad with expressions and my characters usually seem younger or older than they are so it will be a good practice ;w;
