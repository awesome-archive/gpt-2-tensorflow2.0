Last week’s “accidental” photo leak of potential FC Dallas transfer targets continues to pick up steam. Among those players, Colón defender Germán Conti, has been linked to FC Dallas by El Litoral.

El Litoral also states that FC Dallas is not alone in the 6’4 Argentinian defender, and that reigning MLS Cup winners, Toronto FC, are also in the hunt. But these two MLS sides are not the only ones chasing after Conti’s signature as it’s also reported that Brazilian side Atlético Mineiro has already made an initial offer, though 25% less than Colón’s asking price.

What’s most interesting about this report is that it’s stated that Conti’s exit clause is $3.6 million, which would put him as the most expensive transfer in club history.

Conti would certainly be a very interesting pick up for Dallas. At 23, Conti presents himself as an up and coming defender with a high ceiling. Should Dallas secure his services, it wouldn’t surprise me to see him sold to Europe in 3-4 years at much higher price.

As of December 31, 2017 Dallas still only has two centerbacks on the roster, so the club is in need of bodies. Conti’s combination of age, athleticism and upside is certainly the type of player that Oscar Pareja loves to develop. Plus, the ruthlessness of fellow Argentinians Mauro Diaz and Maximiliano Urruti were nowhere near their peak once their trio went down to two after Mauro Rosales left the club.

Here’s a YouTube highlight clip of Conti’s abilities. Obviously this is very difficult to judge anyone based on clips like this, but he certainly does move and defend a lot like Matt Hedges, does he not?

A few years ago, I would’ve scoffed at the idea of Dallas spending $3.6 million on a defender. But after last season’s collapse and the window to capitalize on this team’s potential, it won’t surprise me if the club started investing heavily in securing younger more expensive talents.
