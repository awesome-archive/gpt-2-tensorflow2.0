Today would be a good day to arrest Ben Rhodes

Mr. Rhodes, formally Mr.Obama’s wormtongue, recently used tweeter to suggest he would like to see the Obituaries of VP Mike Pence, House Speaker Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell, on the front page of the NYT.

And remarkably, this piece of shit who used to work in the highest levels of government himself — never apologized for this, or retracted it!

With the tax plan passed, the Iranian people in the streets undoing his treachery and a Trump New Year upon us, today would be a good day for the FBI to put that treasonous SOB, who committed multiple felonies from inside the White House, behind bars where he belongs. The list of crimes he committed, even bragged about, is as long as an anchor chain, but they really should let the Secret Service, who used to protect him, bring him in.

It would give those agents, the thrill of a lifetime.
