In June 2014, the Queen paid a visit to the set of Game of Thrones in Belfast. While the monarch got within inches of the show's famous Iron Throne, she didn't appear to be impressed by the chair, which is made of thousands of swords and definitely doesn't look comfortable. So, much to the disappointment of the show's producers, she turned down the chance to actually sit on it. “Apparently the Queen of England is not allowed to sit on a foreign throne,” executive producer David Benioff explained during an interview with Late Night host Seth Meyers a year later. “This is an esoteric rule we didn’t know about until that moment.” Still, we're sure she appreciated the model version she was presented with at the end of her visit.
