This is the Top 10 Bleeding Cool Bestseller List, as compiled by a number of comic stores from their sales on Wednesday and Thursday. It measures what are known as the “Wednesday Warriors”, those who can’t wait to the weekend to get this week’s comics. We salute you, and the keenness you bring to your passion.

And every single reporting store had Doomsday Clock #2 by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank as their number one.Across the board, with almost all followingup with the Metal-spinoff Hawkman Found. Phoenix Resurrection lagged behind….

Doomsday Clock #2 Hawkman Found #1 Phoenix Resurrection #1 Amazing Spider-Man #793 Detective Comics #971 Action Comics #994 Teen Titans #15 Flash #37 Wonder Woman #37 Thanos #14

Thanks to the following retailers,

And this is what they have to say,

Doomsday Clock dominated again, with both covers outselling (individually even) everything else – though HAWKMAN FOUND would have ranked higher had we ordered more. Wish we had seen the METAL cover design/beforehand – would have ordered more.

Doomsday Clock blew the competition away. Especially that beautiful Lex Luthor cover. Phoenix Resurrection and Amazing Spider-Man topped the sales for Marvel this week.

While DC won for the week with the top 3 slots, Marvel managed to tie them with 5 books placing on the list. There’s measurable excitement growing for Donny Cates’ work on THANOS, and Moon Knight managed to sneak in as well. That said, DOOMSDAY CLOCK sold more than 2nd through 5th place combined– the dominant force and payer of our bills this week.

Big week for books, ok week for sales. Even BigTwo split. On the bottom half of the list Teen Titans falls slightly to below Action, Iron Man, and X-Men: Blue with a surprise of Deadpool making the list at #10. Never thought I’d see a Hawkman book as the second best seller of the week yet here we are. As with nearly all Metal tie-ins our store did not order enough and sold out on Wednesday. Phoenix did well enough to make it to #5 on the list but with numbers far lower than the rest of the upper five. Spider-Man is doing well again at #3 for the week but nothing could touch a sequel to some 80’s book.

Marvel had 6 spots on my top ten this week. Amazing. Hawkman Found came in at number 3. Hawkman has never charted so high in my store, ever. Doomsday Clock was number 1 by a mile, of course. I’m looking forward to next week when all our regulars are back in town. Happy New Year.

Doomsday Clock takes the top spot at FFF, outselling every other book on the shelf by at least 20 copies. Hawkman Found was our second best seller followed by Detective Comics. Phoenix Resurrection was the first Marvel book in our Top Ten with a pretty solid first week. Hopefully people stay interested in a weekly $4 book enough to keep sales strong. Amazing Spider-Man actually managed to sneak into the #10 spot to keep Phoenix company. Metal #4 made it to #8 on it’s second week.

For our Top Twenty, Doomsday Clock continues to sell well, outselling most new books from the week. Thanos fell just outside the Top Ten selling one less copy than Amazing Spider-Man. Batman Creature of the Knight definitely fell off a bit, which is shame for such a good mini, but with all the other Bat-centric books coming out right now it definitely suffers from a lack of publicity.

Redneck and Outcast were the only indie books to make it into the Top Twenty. Both come from big names with solid fanbases so it’s no surprise to see them sell. It is a little shocking to see that Redneck actually hasn’t sold more this week. But we definitely don’t push it as hard as we do Babyteeth.

DC secured the number one and two spots in the final week of the year with a one-two punch of smash hit event comics: DOOMSDAY CLOCK #2 and Metal tie-in HAWKMAN FOUND #1. Marvel didn’t slack off, though, and their lenticular-covered PHOENIX RESURRECTION #1 came in at a strong third place.

DC staples ACTION COMICS and DETECTIVE COMICS round off the top half of the list, while everyone’s favorite neighborhood arachnid is crawling all over the bottom half: AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #793, SPIDER-MEN II #5, and AMAZING SPIDER-MAN RENEW YOUR VOWS #14 all made our top 10.

Doomsday Clock dominated once again this week, selling nearly double the next bestselling comic, Phoenix Resurrection. That’s not to say that The Return of Jean Grey #1 wasn’t a good draw; it just wasn’t enough to take on Doomsday Clock. However, it’s worth noting that if this list weren’t made up of just issues, Saga Volume 8 would’ve been our runner-up this week.

—–

DC sweeps all ten spots in our store this week, with Marvel missing by two copies as Amazing Spider-Man #793 barely lost out to Justice League of America for 10th place. The drop-off on Star Wars titles is almost startling–a major Star Wars film is in theatres right now, and our numbers on most Star Wars books have fallen by 15%.
