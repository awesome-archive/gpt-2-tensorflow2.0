Pre-order Preview: The New Year of Nurgle Begins

Give praise to the Lord of Plagues – a corpulent cornucopia of new models, rules and more approaches to kick off your new year.

Next week, you’ll be able to pre-order the first wave of all the Nurgle-y goodness we’ve been previewing here on Warhammer Community, kicking off with one of Warhammer’s most iconic Daemons – the Great Unclean One:

As well as being packed with new customisation options, weapons – and, of course, Nurglings – this set also allows you to build Rotigus, a terrifying Greater Daemon of Nurgle similar in stature to (but greater in bulk than!) Kairos Fateweaver or Skarbrand.

Of course, it’s not just Nurgle’s greatest minions – next week also sees the pre-order of a range of Nurgle Heralds. We’ve looked at the Spoilpox Scrivener – a vile creature that bullies Plaguebearers into fighting harder on the battlefield – and we think he’s a great addition to any Nurgle collection, but did you know that you’ll also be able to pick up Horticulous Slimux separately? As well as being a great option in the new Nurgle battletome (and even featuring some upgraded abilities), Horticulous will now be available in Warhammer 40,000 thanks to the new Chaos Daemons codex.

Codex: Chaos Daemons and Battletome: Maggotkin of Nurgle will kick off next year’s new rules, and are both packed with new ways to play your Chaos army. If you’ve not checked out our previews of the books yet, make sure you do – there’s a lot to look forward to in each, whether you’ve already started your army or you’re looking for a new one in the new year.

Finally, the Feculent Gnarlmaw will be available next week, allowing you to cap off your Nurgle collection with some thematic scenery (and some handy in-game effects, too). You can find out more about it in our preview, here.

Let us know what you’re most excited about on the Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Age of Sigmar Facebook pages.
