We’ve already made acquaintances with an adorable purple-haired girl and her creator Prudence (you can find the first post about her here), who isn’t afraid of making fun of the everyday problems she faces. Now she’s back with more illustrations of situations a lot of women go through each day, and once again she encourages everyone to forget about those worries and smile.

“Some things in life are just too awkward, too stupid or too hard (or let’s face it: too funny) to deal with,” the author explains her inspiration for the illustrations she uploads on her social media accounts that at this point have over 470k followers. The support she got proved to her that she isn’t alone facing those struggles and revealing them only helps with getting over them.

So, scroll down to see the comics, check out her patreon and follow her on instagram for more.
