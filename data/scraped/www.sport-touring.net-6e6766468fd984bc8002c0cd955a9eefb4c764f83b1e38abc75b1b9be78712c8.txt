Great day! Thank you alphabetman!!! My first ever ride on a TimberSled! What a hoot ... wish I was fitter but a pretty good first day in the mountains with lots of snow!Beautiful day. Dave on his Husqvarna 501 and me on his sons KTM 450. More difficult than it looks ... DO NOT PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN !!!and pretty tiring picking up the bikes in deep powder. But my oh my ...It was nice to have help for the noob !!

It was great having the company poor old 450 has never been treated so nice. Here is a couple more pics from earlier in the week Sent from my Nexus 6 using Tapatalk

That looks tough. Real cold, too! When I was a youngster, people would ask me why I never snow ski. I would tell them that every Winter day I could, I was on my dirt bike!

Cool! (Literally and figurativelySo tell me, how does this compare to a snow mobile? I can see that what you have is lighter and will fall over, but I'm interested in a pro/con list, if you don't mind?
