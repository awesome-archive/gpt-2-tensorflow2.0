Real Madrid Turning point in the Clasico

The time has come for Marco Asensio at Real Madrid, and Zinedine Zidane knows it after a turning point in the Clasico on December 23.

Whilst some will remain untouchable in his team, others could lose their spot, and the French coach knows that he must make changes to the role that some players have in his squad.

Upcoming Copa del Rey fixtures will give fringe players a chance to shine after limited chances in the first half of the season, and Asensio could be one of those to benefit.

A large proportion of Madrid fans are calling for him to be given more minutes.

The former Mallorca sensation had been brought in to be a superstar of the present and future for Real Madrid, and his end to the previous campaign and start to this season looked as though he was ready to deliver.

However, it hasn't quite happened and he has, instead, found himself watching on from the bench, something which has left both fans and the player bewildered.

Hopes for the Spaniard are so high that directors have stopped any potential move for Chelsea's Eden Hazard.

"Why would we bring in the Belgian if we have Asensio?" one senior board figure said in a meeting.

Hazard is a player that Zidane likes, and he has done ever since he played in Lille.

Now, the Chelsea man is even offering himself to Los Blancos.

However, Real remain focused on the development of Asensio, who they believe must play in the most important games, something which he may have less chance of doing with Hazard in the ranks.

Asensio himself is calm, his feet are on the ground and that has helped him to handle his rise to fame.

He wants to play more, but he knows his role in the squad and he is convinced that his time will come.

That could be now.
