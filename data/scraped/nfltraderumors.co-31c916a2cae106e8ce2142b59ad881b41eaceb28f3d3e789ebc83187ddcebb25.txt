Michael Gehlken of the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that the Raiders are expected to move on from WR Michael Crabtree this offseason.

According to Gehlken, changes are coming for the Raiders after a disappointing season in which they failed to build on their 2016 success and it’s likely that Crabtree will be among them.

Ghelken points out that released Crabtree would result in no dead money, considering that he didn’t receive a signing bonus or guarantees in the second half of the agreement.

Crabtree, 30, is a former first-round pick of the 49ers back in 2009. He spent six years in San Francisco before signing on with the Raiders in 2015.

Crabtree is in the third year of his five-year, $34 million contract that included $19 million guaranteed and stands to make base salaries of $6.25 million and $7 million over the next two years of the agreement.

According to OverTheCap.com, releasing Crabtree would free up $7,687,500 of available cap space while creating no dead money.

In 2017, Crabtree has appeared in 13 games and caught 56 passes for 601 yards receiving and eight touchdowns for the Raiders. Pro Football Focus has him rated as the No. 58 receiver out of 116 qualifying players.
