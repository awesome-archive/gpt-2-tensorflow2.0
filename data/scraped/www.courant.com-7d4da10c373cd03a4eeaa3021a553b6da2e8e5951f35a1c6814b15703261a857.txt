For example, among the ideas I have heard, we could reconfigure our income tax to make it an employer-side payroll tax — as the new tax reform law still allows corporations to claim state-and-local tax deductions, just not human beings. Tax receipts would stay the same — but Connecticut taxpayers would effectively keep their federal SALT deductions. Or we could allow people to donate a portion of their income tax payment to a designated state-run nonprofit — perhaps the State Education Resource Center Foundation, claiming a federal charitable deduction that way.
