Eternal Reefs creates permanent living legacies that memorialize the passing of a loved one.

For families and individuals that choose cremation, Eternal Reefs offers a unique memorial choice that replaces cremation urns and ash scatterings with a permanent environmental living legacy as a gift to the environment and generations yet to come.



Families and friends are invited and encouraged to participate in the creation of their loved one’s memorial reef. From placing your hand print in the damp concrete during the casting, making a rubbing of the bronze plaque during the viewing ceremony, or placing a flag on your loved one’s memorial reef during our military honors ceremony, all Eternal Reefs' activities are designed to be a positive experience and provide peace of mind for everyone involved.
