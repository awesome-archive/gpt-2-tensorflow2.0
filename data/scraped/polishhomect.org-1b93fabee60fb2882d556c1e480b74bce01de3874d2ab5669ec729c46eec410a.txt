A message from Acoustic Rick:

I have been singin’ and pickin’ for over 30 years. During those magical years, I have compiled a repertoire of over 2000 songs covering every genre including Rock, Country, Bluegrass, Jazz, Folk, Oldies, and even Show Tunes. I have devoted most of my life to music, and count so many artists as not just influences, but kindred spirits as well. My playlist is a veritable “Who’s Who?” in the world of musical entertainment. I love so many styles of music, that it would be a shame to be pigeon-holed into playing only a few.
