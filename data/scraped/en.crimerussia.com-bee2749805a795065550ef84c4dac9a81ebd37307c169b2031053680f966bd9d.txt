The police were able to identify the suspect thanks to a photo on a flash drive.

The police was able to identify the suspect in the St. Petersburg Perekrestok bombing thanks to a flash drive found in a sausage at the crime scene, according to Fontanka.

The flash drive contained a bomb design and threats towards the Deir Center offering health and prosperity workshops, the publication reports. The police managed to discover what model of a smartphone was used to take the photo and then the owner of the phone.

It is worth mentioning that a flash drive with the same content was found in Deir. However, it was not specified how and when.

35-year-old St. Petersburg resident Dmitry Lukyanenko was arrested on suspicion of being involved with the bombing, according to earlier media reports. The arrestee is a drug addict and a member of the New Age occult movement, according to some reports. When questioned, Lukyanenko said he had attended Deir’s workshops and decided to set off the bomb to protest what he was told there, according to Fontanka. The arrestee “was registered with a mental hospital and was asocial,” TASS reports.

To recall, the bomb was detonated in the Perekrestok supermarket on the Kondratievsky Avenue on the evening of December 27. 18 people were wounded. The bomb was homemade and was equivalent to 200 grams of TNT, forensic specialists say. It was hidden in a storage locker.
