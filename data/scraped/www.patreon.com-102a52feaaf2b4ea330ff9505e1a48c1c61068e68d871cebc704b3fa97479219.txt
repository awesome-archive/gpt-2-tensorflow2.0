Started a new series for a hidden ruined castle. The above map is the western forest entry/outpost.

Description:

A small creek flows easterly down a gully, following the creek you notice the remains of an old bridge crossing a larger river, though the bridge now in ruins. In the distance you can see large mountains rising above the forest.

Across the river you see what appears to be the remains of a lone tower in ruins sticking out from the green forest around it.
