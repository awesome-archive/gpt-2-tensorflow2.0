The Seventh Day of Nurgle: The Feculent Gnarlmaw

We’ve seen beasts, Daemons and monsters great and small in our 7 Days of Nurgle previews, and today, we’re looking at some special new Nurgle scenery that’s on the way – the Feculent Gnarlmaw.

The Feculent Gnarlmaw is a new piece of terrain for both Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Age of Sigmar. As well as allowing you to build appropriately grotesque gaming tables, the Feculent Gnarlmaw has a suite of special rules to support a Nurgle army, and work particularly well with Horticulous Slimux, who can cause them to sprout up mid-game.

Finally, here’s your last wallpaper – download it free here.
