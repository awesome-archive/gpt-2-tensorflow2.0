Twitter is one of the most powerful websites ever. It can create and change opinions, enlighten the masses and even teach you how to cook. It can also make players All-Stars. Nets fans have taken to the website to try and get Spencer Dinwiddie to represent the Eastern Conference.

While some players make the All-Star based on merit, or even simply tradition, others need a little help. That is why the league lets fans vote. Think Zaza Pachulia last season, who nearly made the team, or Allen Iverson in 2010, who made the team despite not playing for a majority of the season. Spencer Dinwiddie could possibly be the next social media made All-Star.

While the Brooklyn Nets‚Äô starting point guard has had a great season, he has done so quietly. When it comes to the All-Star game, this poses problem as recognition is everything. The more easily fans can recognize you, the easier it is to get in.

In order to get around that particular hurdle, fans have taken to Twitter and, according to Dinwiddie, have flooded the Colorado product‚Äôs mentions.

Whoever organized all this and is flooding my mentions with Spencer Dinwiddie #NBAVote I appreciate y‚Äôall lol ‚úäüèæ ‚Äî Spencer Dinwiddie (@SDinwiddie_25) December 31, 2017

Unlike in past years when players had to be voted in, the league has changed up the format of the All-Star Game. Rather than voting for the conference‚Äôs starters, fans now vote for captains. The two players with the highest votes become captains and then can choose who they want to play with based a pool of vote getters.
