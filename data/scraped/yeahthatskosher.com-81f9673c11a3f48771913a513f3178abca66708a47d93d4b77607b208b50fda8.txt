Recently, the popular kosher dairy eatery & pizzeria in South Florida, Foozo Artisan Pizza, moved its original location a block away, expanding into a larger space that was formerly occupied by Blaze BBQ and Fuego, which had closed down at 2520 NE Miami Gardens Dr. in North Miami Beach.

Expanding further into South Florida, Foozo is opening up a second, brand new location in Bay Harbour Islands, minutes from Bal Harbour and the strip of kosher restaurants in Surfside. (see map below)

This new location is set to open in about a week.

Foozo is potentially one of the better kosher pizzerias in the country, offering not just pizzas, but an array of top quality items (see menu inclusions below) that most kosher pizzerias largely ignore.

They are known for their high-end, innovative pizzas, pastas, salads, and friendly service. Foozo’s menu items include Foozballs (cheesy arancini balls), truffle parmesan fries, a whole slew of pizzas including the “White Hot” (White sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Ricotta, Goat cheese, roasted mushrooms, roasted garlic, banana peppers, sea salt topping), “Sabich” (Fresh tomato, roasted eggplant, red onion, boiled egg, banana peppers, topped with tahini sauce), and “The Foozo” (Fresh Mozzarella, Ricotta cheese, pesto sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, black olives, red onions); as well as Foozolis (similar to pizza rolls; Salads which are plentiful and fresh including their Caesar, Sweet Kale, Arugula, Santorini, and others; and their Pastas which include Baked Tony (Rigatoni, house made marinara, ricotta, shredded mozzarella finished in the wood fire pizza), Cheesy Mac (Cavatappi, house white sauce, mozzarella, Parmesan….finished in the wood fire oven), Tartufo Gemelli (white sauce, wild mushroom topped with truffle oil and arugula), and others.
