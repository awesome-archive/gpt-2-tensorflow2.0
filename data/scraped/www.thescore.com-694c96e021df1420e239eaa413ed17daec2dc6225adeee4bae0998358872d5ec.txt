Team USA will be down a forward for the remainder of the World Junior Hockey Championship.

Coach Bob Motzko confirmed that winger William Lockwood won't suit up again this tournament as he's sidelined with an upper-body injury.

Lockwood sustained the injury in Friday's shootout win over Team Canada. He has two penalty minutes and a minus-1 rating through three round-robin games.

The Vancouver Canucks selected Lockwood with the 64th pick in 2016. He's tallied 11 points in 16 games with the University of Michigan this season.
