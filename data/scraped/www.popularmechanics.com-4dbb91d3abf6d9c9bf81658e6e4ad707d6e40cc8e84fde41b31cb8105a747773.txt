Tesla has been hyping its Model 3 vehicles since they were announced in 2014. The car was designed to be an affordable all-electric sedan, but despite receiving approximately half a million pre-orders the company has so far only delivered a few hundred units. However, that might be about to change: Electrek is reporting that ‘hundreds’ of new Model 3s have been leaving the Tesla factory over the past few days.

Electrek published drone video footage yesterday of a parking lot at the Tesla factory in Fremont full of Model 3s being loaded onto trucks. This comes after footage last week of the that same factory with an estimated 500 Model 3s in the same parking lot. It’s unclear whether the footage published yesterday features the same cars as the video published a week ago, or if these are new cars.

Either way, this represents a significant acceleration in Tesla’s Model 3 production. The company only delivered 712 Model 3s total by November, and according to these videos the company stands to nearly double that number in December.

This means that Tesla might be on track to meet its 2018 goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by March 2018. If that’s the case, people might not have to wait as long for their cars as they thought.
