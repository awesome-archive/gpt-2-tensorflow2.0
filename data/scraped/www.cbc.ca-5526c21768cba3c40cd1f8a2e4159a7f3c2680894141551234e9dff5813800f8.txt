CBC went to dozens of countries, hundreds of Canadian communities and recorded countless hours of video to bring you the news in 2017. For the people capturing those images, there are particular moments that stand out above the rest.

Here are the most memorable images of the year, as selected by the videographers and photographers who shot them, along with their stories about what it was like being there.

Ain Issa, Syria

Jean-Francois Bisson is a Toronto-based video producer who takes on assignments around world. This year, that included a trip to Ain Issa, Syria, where he and Adrienne Arsenault sat down with an ISIS bride. Her eyes still haunt him.
