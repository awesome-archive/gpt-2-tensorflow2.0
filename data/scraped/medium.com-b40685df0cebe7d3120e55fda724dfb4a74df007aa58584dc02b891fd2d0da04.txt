Quick Guide: How to Buy Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies

DISCLAIMER: This is not investment advice and readers should note that cryptocurrencies are high risk and volatile investments. This is my personal advice as a successful investor in the crypto markets. Note that I have included my referral links to Coinbase and Binance trading platforms. Although it is not required by you to use my referrals in benefits you as Coinbase will give you and I both $10 USD worth of Bitcoin for your first $100+ invested.

This guide serves to assist you in purchasing some of the most well known and upcoming cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin.

Basic Strategy to purchasing your first CryptoCurrency

So far this seems to be the most basic and simple steps for people looking to buy their desired Crypto investments

1. First, register with a Coinbase.com account. Coinbase is easy to work with and has an app in the Apple store and Android store for downloading. It is currently the most trusted exchange for beginners and is how most people have started their investment journey into the world of cryptocurrencies.

2. Go through the verification process. This requires at least one form of ID. Coinbase takes no more than 10 minutes to have your account and ID officially verified.

3. You will now be able to enter whichever method of payment you prefer. This can be via bank transfer or credit/debit card etc.

4. After payment details are entered you are able to purchase either Bitcoin, Ethereum, LiteCoin or BitcoinCash. (If you plan on buying other known CryptoCurrencies on a bigger exchange, it’s best to start with Ethereum as it has the fastest transaction times and lowest fees.)

5. Register with Binance.com. This is the largest exchange by volume currently and they trade almost all the popular lesser known alternative and upcoming CryptoCurrencies, including Ripple, Monero, IOTA and NEO etc. Furthermore you can trade and withdraw up to 2BTC (currently about $25’000) worth per day without requiring ID. Those who wish to buy and withdraw more than that will need to submit ID. Note: A list has been included at the end of this article showing all the coins currently available to trade on Binance.

6. Once you have registered with Binance you will have free wallets on the exchange for every Crypto currency that it offers. In order to trade on Binance you will need to use either Ethereum or Bitcoins that you have purchased.

7. You may then transfer your Ethereum or Bitcoin to the Binance wallet given to you under the “FUNDS” tab from your Coinbase Account. Note that you must enter the address on your Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet correctly or it will not go through. Always double check that you are depositing the right Coin and the address has no mistakes.

8. Once sent to your Binance wallet, you may now trade your Bitcoin or Ethereum for whichever coin you wish. Just remember that transfer times vary and are not instant for Ethereum (10 minutes+) and Bitcoin (1 to 24 hours).

Note: My referral codes are as follow for those of you who have not yet signed up with the exchanges mentioned:
