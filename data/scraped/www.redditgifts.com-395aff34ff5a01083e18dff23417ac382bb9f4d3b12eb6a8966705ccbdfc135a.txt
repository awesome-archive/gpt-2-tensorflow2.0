This morning turned out to be a truly wonderful and happy morning - I got my Secret Santa gift!!! She really took the time and even went to my Amazon wish list, getting me my favorite Turkish Delight candies, oh my goodness, that brought tears to my eyes, as my best friend lives in Turkey!

She even gave my cats the best catnip 'red hot chili pepper' toys, and my little Esme won't stop playing with hers! Lapis is still asleep by the fire ;)

And the pens and great coloring books, and - Japanese Kit Kats!!!

Thank you, so much. You made me smile a lot!!! Happy New Year!!!
