One week after Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile releases Android Oreo for the Moto Z2 Force handsets on its network. The new firmware comes without any surprises and includes picture-in-picture mode, improved notifications, and more.

The Moto Z2 Force by Lenovo has been around since August when it arrived on the market with Android 7.1.1 Nougat onboard. In the meantime, this interesting modular smartphone received Android Oreo as well. However, not all carrier versions got the refresh at the same time. About a week ago, Verizon Wireless became the first US carrier to roll out the Oreo firmware to the Moto Z2 Force units on its network. Now, the time has come for T-Mobile to do the same.

According to the screenshots shared online by one of those who already got the update, the new firmware includes the security patch dated December 1, 2017. The list of changes includes the usual Oreo goodies, such as picture-in-picture mode or the ability to snooze notifications separately, not to mention the overall performance and autonomy improvements.

Although the competition in the high-end sector of the mobile market is fierce these days, the 5.5-inch Moto Z2 Force remains a flagship still worthy of attention, since it features a high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4 GB or 6 GB RAM, and 64 GB or 128 GB internal storage, not to mention the dual camera setup on its back and the ability to improve its capabilities or add new ones thanks to the modules simply known as Moto Mods.
