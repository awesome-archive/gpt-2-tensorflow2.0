While all the rumors of coaching changes and various big moves linger for the Oakland Raiders, we can now add one more report to the mix, and this one is about the future of wide receiver Michael Crabtree.

As Michael Gehlken of the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, the Raiders are "expected" to move on from Crabtree this offseason.

The Raiders are expected to move on from their wide receiver this offseason. There has been a measure of dysfunction behind the scenes of a 6-9 campaign that will conclude Sunday at the Los Angeles Chargers. Changes are coming, and sources have indicated those will include parting with a player whose production is not considered worth the baggage.

It's interesting to hear about the "baggage" that Gehlken mentions. Even still, the Raiders will be losing a big part of their offense should they choose to go this route, but also would free up over $7.68 million in cap space by doing so, per Over The Cap.

Crabtree has tallied 1,925 yards and 17 touchdowns over the past two full seasons while putting up 601 yards and eight touchdowns in 13 games so far this season.

If Crabtree is released, it likely either means that the team sees an expanded role for another wideout on their roster, or that they'll look to the draft or free agency to add a new face.
