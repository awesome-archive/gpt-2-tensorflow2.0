A message from Natsume president and CEO Hiro Maekawa:

Happy New Year to our Worldwide Fans! The year 2017 was a very special and memorable year for us. It was the 20th Anniversary of our Harvest Moon franchise. Taking this opportunity, I would like to share my unforgettable memory about the birth of Harvest Moon with all our loyal Harvest Moon fans. It was 1996 when I first came across an unknown farming simulation game for the SNES. I played the game, and found it very unique and heartwarming, something I had never seen before. My instinct told me that this niche game might have great potential to grow in America, given that America is a large farming country. At the same time, I felt a sense of nostalgia about the game, since I was born and spent my childhood in the countryside of Japan. At that time, I was a newcomer to the video game industry, and I did not know much about the U.S. video game market. So, I decided to check with my associates in the industry to see what they thought about this game. To my shock, all the comments I got were extremely negative! Basically, they said that the game was very boring, there was no excitement, and there would be no market for this type of bland game in the U.S. All the negative comments were understandable in hindsight due to the fact there was no such video game genre as ‚ÄúFarming Simulations‚Äù at that time. However, it was my strong intuition that this non-violent, family-oriented game could have a big potential to resonate with fans in this country. Based on this belief, I decided to release, this game and named it Harvest Moon. And this is how Harvest Moon was born twenty years ago! In celebration of Harvest Moon‚Äòs 20th Anniversary, we have developed a new Harvest Moon title, Harvest Moon: Light of Hope. It is the first Harvest Moon title to be multi-platform, as it is for PC (Steam), Nintendo Switch, and Sony PlayStation 4. The PC version of Harvest Moon: Light of Hope was released for Steam in November, and we are very happy with its sales performance thus far. Harvest Moon: Light of Hope for the Switch and PS4 are scheduled to be released early this year, both physical and download. Thanks to the continued support by loyal Harvest Moon fans worldwide, this once-unknown farming simulation game has grown to be one of the best-known family-oriented franchises for gamers of all ages! We sincerely appreciate all those loyal fans for their continued support. We have several other exciting titles coming this year in addition to Harvest Moon: Light of Hope for Switch and PlayStation 4, so please stay tuned! Our company mission for the past 23 years has always been, and will continue to be, to ‚ÄúMake Everyone Happy‚Äù with exciting, interactive entertainment software for the entire family. At Natsume, ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù means all of our customers, Natsume employees, and all of the people we work with, such as our development partners, our distribution partner, retailers, financial institutions, media, and all of the people who are directly or indirectly connected with Natsume and our products. We at Natsume are committed to continuing our corporate mission to ‚ÄúMake Everyone Happy,‚Äù and we would appreciate your continued support. Wishing ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù a very happy, healthy, and wonderful New Year! Sincerely,

Hiro Maekawa

A letter from Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda:

I would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year. The environment surrounding the content industry is undergoing significant changes as advancements are made simultaneously in multiple technologies, including AI, xR (VR, AR, MR), next-generation communications systems, and payment infrastructure. As a result of these advances, consumers are likely to enjoy richer content experiences and greater convenience. These environmental changes look poised to gather further momentum going forward, and we expect them to serve as a tailwind for our Group. As such, we will forge ahead with our content development efforts and accelerate the expansion of our global content business. Disruptive technological evolution gains speed In 2017, AI garnered considerable attention globally for its far-reaching disruptive potential, and advancements were made in the commercialization and uptake of xR (VR, AR, MR) technologies. With the Olympic and Paralympic Games set to be held in Tokyo in 2020, Japan is preparing to ramp up its 5G infrastructure build-out. In the near future, this effort should result in mobile networks that provide constant connectivity and support massive data traffic at a low cost. Since HTML5 already enables web browsers to display high-quality 3D on par with native apps, browsers may garner renewed attention as a gaming platform once 5G networks are in place. The expanded application of fintech is also capable of putting emerging market payment infrastructure on par with that of advanced nations in short order. Payment infrastructure is as vital to digital content businesses as is communications infrastructure, so its rapid development should serve as a significant tailwind to the geographic expansion of our Group‚Äôs businesses. As these examples illustrate, technological advancements result in new forums for creating content and in new business opportunities. For this reason, they are a major enabler for content producers in their efforts to provide their customers with new experiences. We look for such advancements to gain even further momentum in 2018 and beyond. A richer lineup of digital content platforms Another key feature of the current digital content landscape is the smartphone. Annual global smartphone shipments are now in excess of 1.5 billion units1, making the smartphone an essential device for the enjoyment of digital contents, and the evolution of smartphone technology knows no bounds. In the consumer game console space, March 2017 saw the release of the Nintendo Switch, which has proven a major global success, selling more than 10 million units worldwide. PlayStation 4 has also seen sales of more than 70 million units, and the Xbox One series, which has just added the Xbox One X to its lineup, got off to a good start during the holiday season. These successes present major business opportunities to game publishers and developers. 2017 was also a year in which Japanese game titles represented a significant presence on the global consumer console game market. While the consumer console game market has been solid in the West over the past several years, it has struggled in Japan. However, we expect the Japanese market to gain significant vitality going forward as it joins the overall trend. New amazement and fun for our customers everywhere In 2017, our Group saw results from our ongoing strategy of portfolio expansion as we were able to generate numerous hits with major and mid-sized titles in entertainment content markets around the world. In 2018, we will leverage the aforementioned global acceleration in technological evolution as well as prevailing market trends in order to provide high-quality, highly creative contents so that we can bring new amazement and fun to our customers the world over. We thank you for your continued support in the new year. Yosuke Matsuda
