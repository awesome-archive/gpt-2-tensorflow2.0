Rep. DeSantis Destroys NY Times Papadopoulos ‘Bombshell”: It Conflicts with Previous Stories – No One Can Say This Under Oath (Video)

On Saturday The New York Times reported from Deep State leaks that Trump campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos set in motion the ‘Russian collusion’ investigation.

This was a surprising charge considering most analysts now believe it was the Hillary-funded phony Trump-Russia dossier that allowed Deep State to spy on the Trump campaign.

Papadopoulos was charged earlier this year and pleaded guilty in October of making false statements to the FBI. He wasn’t charged with ‘Russian collusion’. Papadopoulos was charged with making a false statement to the FBI because talking to Russians is not illegal. On Saturday the New York Times reported it was Papadopoulos and not the dossier that prompted the Russia investigation.

The entire premise was debunked Saturday within hours of the Times report.

On Sunday Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-CA) also refuted the New York Times Papadopoulos report.

Rep. Ron DeSantis: I think what they’re doing be resisting but then actually leaking certain facts to the media. There was just an article in The New York Times yesterday where they’re leaking about this Papadopoulos which actually conflicts with the previous stories and is not anything anyone can say under oath on the record to us. You look at that and say, “Ok you’re not willing to answer Congress’s questions under oath but you’ll leak things to the media?” That is not the way this is supposed to work!

This is more evidence that the corrupt Mueller witch hunt should be shut down today.
