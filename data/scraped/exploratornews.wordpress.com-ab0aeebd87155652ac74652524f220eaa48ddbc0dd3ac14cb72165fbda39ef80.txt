EXPLORATOR is a free weekly newsletter bringing you the latest

news of archaeological finds, historical research and the like.

Various on-line news and magazine sources are scoured for news of

the ‘ancient world’ (broadly construed: practically anything relating

to archaeology or history up to a century or so ago is fair

game) and every Sunday they are delivered to your mailbox free of

charge!
