… then let us make a small request. AlterNet is increasing its original reporting, edited by The Nation’s Joshua Holland, with a focus on 2020 election coverage. We’ve also launched a weekly podcast, “We’ve Got Issues,” focusing on the issues, not Donald Trump’s tweets. Unlike other news outlets, we’ve decided to make our AlterNet 2020 coverage free to all. But we need your ongoing support to continue what we do.

AlterNet is independent. You won’t find mainstream media bias here. From unflinching coverage of white nationalism, to spotlighting the overlooked struggles of the working poor, AlterNet continues to speak truth to power. As newspapers close, America needs voices like AlterNet’s to be sure no one is forgotten.

We need your support to keep producing quality journalism. As Silicon Valley absorbs more and more advertising dollars, ads don’t pay what they used to. Every reader contribution, whatever the amount, makes a tremendous difference. Help ensure AlterNet remains independent long into the future.
