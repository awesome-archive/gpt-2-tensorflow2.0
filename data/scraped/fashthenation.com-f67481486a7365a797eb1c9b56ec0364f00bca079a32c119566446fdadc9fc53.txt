McFeels and Halberstram return from Christmas break to bring you the latest on the goings on of the past week, beginning with the year-in-review of 2017. It has been a red letter year indeed. Then, a look ahead with our very own FTN SWOT analysis for 2018 and onto things heating up with immigration and the steady collapse of the Russian collusion narrative. From Democrat malaise and more cucks dropping like flies from the national stage, to the many missteps of Team Bannon as they break the cardinal rule of politics to never cuck. Itâ€™s all ahead on Fash the Nation!
