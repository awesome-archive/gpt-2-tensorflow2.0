Labour is warning of a fresh Universal Credit crisis next year.

Its analysis shows the number hit by deductions is 20 times higher than for other benefits.

Department for Work and Pensions statistics show the number with a Universal Credit deduction reached 6.9% in March this year.

For Employment and Support Allowance and Jobseeker’s Allowance, the deduction rate was 0.3% and 0.4%.

Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams said the crisis will worsen as the credit roll-out quickens next year.

Then hundreds of thousands of working people must meet criteria to be eligible for the benefit.

“The Tories should fix Universal Credit before it causes even more misery for families,” she insisted.

“It is shameful that the sanctions rate for Universal Credit is now 20 times higher than for other forms of social security.

“With more and more low-paid workers becoming subject to conditionality, this is a crisis that is only set to deepen if the Tories continue to press ahead with their botched roll out of Universal Credit."
