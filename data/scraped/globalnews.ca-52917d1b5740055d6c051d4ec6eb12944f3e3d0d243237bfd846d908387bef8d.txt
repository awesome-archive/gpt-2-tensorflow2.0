Colombia has shipped around 50 tonnes (55 tons) of ham to Venezuela after protests broke out over shortages of the traditional holiday staple, an official said Saturday.

The first two trucks of ham arrived in Venezuela on Friday night, a source from Colombia’s national tax and customs office told AFP.

On Saturday, there were “two other trucks ready to go,” but awaiting final procedural approval, the source added, without specifying the amount of ham in that shipment.
