NYT ‘Russia Papadopoulos Bombshell’ Completely Unravels Within Hours of Publication

Fake News New York Times is doing everything they can to steer the public away from Hillary Clinton’s multi-million dollar garbage dossier the Deep State used in order to spy on Trump’s campaign. The fake dossier ultimately sparked the ‘Russian collusion’ witch hunt.

If the dossier wasn’t used in order to obtain a FISA warrant, then SHOW THE PUBLIC THE FISA APPS!

On Saturday The New York Times implied Trump campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos set in motion the ‘Russian collusion’ investigation, not the Hillary-funded dossier.

Papadopoulos was already charged. He wasn’t charged with ‘Russian collusion’. Papadopoulos was charged with making a false statement to the FBI because talking to Russians is not illegal, yet he’s what prompted the Russia investigation?

The fake news media is beyond pathetic.

Excerpt from the NYT fake news article:

WASHINGTON — During a night of heavy drinking at an upscale London bar in May 2016, George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, made a startling revelation to Australia’s top diplomat in Britain: Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton. About three weeks earlier, Mr. Papadopoulos had been told that Moscow had thousands of emails that would embarrass Mrs. Clinton, apparently stolen in an effort to try to damage her campaign. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear. But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians’ role. The hacking and the revelation that a member of the Trump campaign may have had inside information about it were driving factors that led the F.B.I. to open an investigation in July 2016 into Russia’s attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of President Trump’s associates conspired. If Mr. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness, was the improbable match that set off a blaze that has consumed the first year of the Trump administration, his saga is also a tale of the Trump campaign in miniature. He was brash, boastful and underqualified, yet he exceeded expectations. And, like the campaign itself, he proved to be a tantalizing target for a Russian influence operation. The information that Mr. Papadopoulos gave to the Australians answers one of the lingering mysteries of the past year: What so alarmed American officials to provoke the F.B.I. to open a counterintelligence investigationinto the Trump campaign months before the presidential election? It was not, as Mr. Trump and other politicians have alleged, a dossier compiled by a former British spy hired by a rival campaign. Instead, it was firsthand information from one of America’s closest intelligence allies.

The New York Times got DESTROYED within hours of publication…

Conservative Treehouse completely broke down their latest Russian conspiracy.

1) Um Maggie, [@maggieNYT ] hate to undercut your *explosive story* on origin of Russia Probe. But George Papadopoulos talking in May 2016, is likely about this *open and public information* from April 2016. https://t.co/t9qtqDoLdQ — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

2.) Additionally, worth noting @maggieNYT is nowhere in the Joint Analysis Report [Comey, Brennan and Clapper construct] is anything about George Papadopoulos even hinted or alluded to. — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

3.) [@maggieNYT ] ABC in Australia is reporting it was Alexander Downer (Australian High Commissioner to UK) who then let counterparts in US know that George Papadopolous was talking about the Sidney Blumental hack via Clinton Emails. — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

4.) The @maggieNYT is also nonsense based on common sense. Papadopoulos was so important that: July 15th 2016 Comey opens counterintel investigation into Russian collusion. January 15th 2017 FBI visits Papadopoulos for first time. FBI waited for six months to talk to him? — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

5. @maggieNYT If George Papadopoulos was so important to the FBI “investigation” why did all “intelligence” agencies released their final JAR report without ever speaking to him?

Not even once? — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

6. No @maggieNYT what you have in your article is a well constructed and brutally familiar pattern of what journalism looks like when the IC use reporters to cover their tracks and create a justification based on a false premise. — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

7. The Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, Mary Jacoby, Nellie Ohr etc. and subsequent Christopher Steele origin of the FISA application source material is a risk to the former leadership within the DOJ National Security Division and FBI Counterintelligence Division. — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

8. @maggieNYT That’s why both FBI and DOJ sides of this intelligence operation need to create a false origin. The actual FISA application content is a much more explosive risk. Use your common sense logic hat and see when you are being played. — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

9. @maggieNYT USE COMMON SENSE: If a Papadopolous conversation in May 2016 was the origin, the source material, of the FBI counterintelligence operation, then why were they denied a FISA application in June/July 2016 ? — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

10. @maggieNYT The wife of Glenn Simpson (Fusion GPS), Mary B. Jacoby, with years of Russia-angled reporting –including Donald Trump– visits the White House on April 19th 2016. https://t.co/2dqBvDPWYw pic.twitter.com/j90bqiF4X7 — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

11. @maggieNYT Mary B Jacoby is a deep part of Clinton’s political camp going all the way back to the Rose Law Firm. You know that because you know her. After the April 19, 2016, WH visit, the DNC and Clinton campaign hire Mary and Glenn (Fusion GPS) for the “trump project”. pic.twitter.com/q22kOWXqB6 — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

12. @maggieNYT Immediately after Fusion was paid, Glenn Simpson and Mary Jacoby (Fusion GPS Patriarchs), hire Nellie Ohr. pic.twitter.com/L8jrjyDCh4 — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

13. @maggieNYT As you know, Nellie Ohr is the wife of DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr. The same Bruce Ohr who was demoted for meeting with Glenn Simpson and Christopher Steele, along with FBI agent Peter Strzok, w/out telling DOJ leadership. pic.twitter.com/aDsieAWMzd — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

14. @maggieNYT Again, you know this stuff. Nellie Ohr, Bruce Ohr and Glenn Simpson have known each other for years; and have worked on CIA *open source* projects together for a long time. pic.twitter.com/8Gp93KYMc4 — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

15 @maggieNYT As you know all of these people are SME’s on everything Russia and everything Russia intelligence. It is all of this activity in April and May, not innocuous George Papadopolous reading newspapers, that assembled data and eventually led to the “Russia Probe”. — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

16. @maggieNYT on June 24th 2017 Mary Jacoby even publicly stated on her facebook that her work with Glenn is what specifically led to the FBI beginning the “Russia Probe”. https://t.co/Zkg0EjpOXE — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

17. @maggieNYT After the initial July 2016 FISA Court denial, the FBI and DOJ team leaned heavily on the external team of Jacoby, Simpson, Ohr, Steele etc. who created the “dossier” that enhanced the application that gained the FISA warrant in Oct. pic.twitter.com/24uYStbtZt — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

18. @maggieNYT as you know, because of the legal framework around them, FISA warrants can be applied retroactively. Wiretaping and monitoring can technically begin while evidence is gathered to justify a DOJ-NSD warrant application later. pic.twitter.com/Kg7GaTEown — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

19. @maggieNYT Which is exactly what former DOJ Attorney General John P. Carlin, National Security Division head, admitted to the FISA Court (October 2016) right before he quit his job. https://t.co/SvQRK9hzjv — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

20. So @maggieNYT the question I have for you is: Did you write that nonsense about George Papadopolous because the IC (FBI/DOJ) tricked you into it?….. OR were you a willing participant in helping transmit political disinformation in an effort to help them cover their tracks? pic.twitter.com/3ZA7XihoVT — TheLastRefuge (@TheLastRefuge2) December 30, 2017

Rep Ron DeSantis has asked for Obama-Comey FISA apps to be declassified. As soon as we know what prompted the FISA warrant, we will begin to understand the origin of the ‘Russian collusion’ witch hunt. The reason why the Deep State is fighting the dossier so much is because we all know it is the fruit of the poison tree as Tom Fitton says.

Rep Ron DeSantis said in a statement:

“We now know that the so-called Steele dossier was paid for by the Democratic Party in an effort to gin up negative information regarding then-candidate Trump. What the American people deserve to know is whether the information compiled by Steele on the Democrats’ dime was used by the Obama administration to obtain approval to conduct surveillance against Trump associates. The FBI has stonewalled producing these documents for months and their production shouldn’t be limited to closed door viewing by a small number of members of Congress. The Trump administration should immediately declassify all the documents used to obtain surveillance warrants against Trump or his associates.”

Nice try, New York Times; certainly that ‘report’ took some of your precious time to produce, however; we will never stop demanding an investigation into the dossier.

The brilliant Byron York of the Washington Examiner asked some pertinent questions that further poked holes in the desperate New York Times article about Papadopoulos:

So: 1) If Papadopoulos actions drove FBI probe, why wait til nearly Feb 2017 to interview him? If done to keep probe quiet before election, why wait more than two months after vote? 2/4 — Byron York (@ByronYork) December 30, 2017

2) When did officials brief Congress about Papadopoulos? They briefed Congress about Carter Page in late summer 2016. 3/4 — Byron York (@ByronYork) December 30, 2017

3) Did officials seek a surveillance warrant on Papadopoulos? They reportedly got one on Carter Page in summer 2016. Did they try to get one on Papadopoulos? If not, why not? 4/4 — Byron York (@ByronYork) December 30, 2017

One add: Not saying Papadopoulos played no role. But questions about whether his part was so central in starting FBI probe in July 2016. — Byron York (@ByronYork) December 30, 2017

Oh, sh**. So funny, I almost peed my pants.@maggieNYT and @nytimes just got nuked again on their “Papadopoulos Scoop”, a hilarious attempt to defect attention from the Fusion GPS “Dossier”.https://t.co/5vcb5dGbVo Full timeline here: https://t.co/L7iIFWNmdC@TheLastRefuge2 — Doug Ross 🔵 (@directorblue) December 31, 2017
