For a price of 37,500 GBP, roughly $50,000, this "Diablo" comes powered by a BMW-sourced 5.0-liter V12 paired to a six-speed manual transmission sourced from Audi. Okay, so far so decent. It has just 1,700 miles and we're assuming those were all put on once the build was completed. The ad is, unfortunately, a bit vague when it comes to specifics like that. It does mention, however, the engine was stripped and rebuilt before it was installed in the fake Lambo. Speaking of which, nowhere does it mention the source of the chassis. Was it custom-built or taken from a donor car? Parallel Designs does write the chassis consist of a "semi-spaceframe design with integral central backbone providing excellent strength and rigidity."
