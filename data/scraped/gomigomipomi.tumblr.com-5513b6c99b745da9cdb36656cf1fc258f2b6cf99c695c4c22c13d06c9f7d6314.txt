Let’s see…what did I draw thorough the year of 2017…

Anyway, HAPPY NEW YEAR IN ADVANCE EVERYONE!

I wanna take this opportunity to thank all of you for liking/enjoying my works and for accompanying me thorough 2017. I know I’m not exactly active online and sometimes even slow on updates, but I thank you for being patience with me while I juggle between tasks. I’m glad for every like/share/message/follow for my works. I’m happy for the support I received for my new store. I can’t stress enough how grateful I am for all of these.

Thank you so much. I will be seeing you all in 2018. :)
