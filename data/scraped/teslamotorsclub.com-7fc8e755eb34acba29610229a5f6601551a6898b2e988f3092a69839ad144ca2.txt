There was no problem prior to publishing so I don't see how getting the e-mail's author story prior to publishing would help:



The e-mail generated tremendous sales and customer satisfaction due to broadcasting the lower price.



After the publishing, Tesla does not publicly argue about the lower pricing.



1) It disagrees about how to call it. It also abhors the word "deal" which the e-mail never mentioned.



2) It disagrees that the e-mail author had authorization to send the e-mail.



Those disagreements did not happen prior to publishing.
