ETH experienced a massive rise to a price of $390 USD in June of 2017, where it reached its closest to surpassing BTC as the largest market cap as a percentage of the entire market. Since that time, BTC continued to assert dominance in the market as it rose to a massive price peak of over $19,000 in December of 2017. Through April of 2018, ETH and BTC have both taken price hits, but the dominance in the market cap percentage has been rising for BTC, while it has been steadily decreasing for ETH. This is interesting considering the growing number of Ethereum dapps...



Ethereum dapps, which are many of the projects that you have seen ICO using ERC20 tokens, actually make up an astounding 85% of all crypto assets that have been issued under existing blockchains. All of these run on ETH as their ‘gas’ and rely on it to successfully operate, making Ethereum’s value crucial in the scope of smart contract projects. Because of Ethereum’s unique ability to cultivate and support deployment of crypto projects, it is in a great position to continue to thrive in this space. While there are cryptocurrencies that are building very similar functionality and even claim to have advantages over ETH, such as EOS and Cardano (ADA) - they have no working products at the moment. It will be important to keep an eye on projects like these, but ETH talks the talk and walks the walk.



While BTC is certainly the king of crypto today, ETH is the king of dapps. You can view all Ethereum projects, including 515 that are live and actively earning profits at State of the dapps. This increasing dapp support, along with the recent slide in market cap dominance, could be an indicator of an Ethereum run to come when the bear market subsides. ETH trades at $363 USD today on just about all crypto platforms such as Bittrex, Coinbase, Gemini and Binance.
