Bostonians may ring in 2018 with warmth in their hearts, but it will be bitterly cold outside. A wind chill advisory is in effect for the area from 8 p.m. Sunday night through noon on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The NWS reported that locals should expect wind chills to range from 5 below zero to 20 below zero.

Considering the intense cold and “by the recommendation of public safety,” organizers of 2018 Boston First Night have amended the event schedule. Sunday’s Frog Pond Skating Spectacular and People’s Procession to Boston Common, both slated for 6 p.m., are canceled. Boston’s Family Fireworks, meant to take place at 7 p.m., have also been canceled, as have the Copley Square Stage Performances, on the docket for New Year’s Day from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

For all other events, including the midnight fireworks display and Enchanted Forest ice sculpture presentation, organizers urge caution and ask that attendees dress warmly.

The NWS warns that these cold wind chills can cause frostbite to exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes, and recommends heading inside often to warm up.

Mayor Marty Walsh also asked residents to be careful if they decide to partake in the festivities.

“First Night is a great Boston tradition that many families look forward to each year. This year, New Year’s Eve is going to be extremely cold, so we’re asking residents to use their best judgment if they choose to be outside for any duration of time,” Walsh said in a statement. “I urge residents to look out for another and remain vigilant as we experience some of the coldest weather our city has seen in years, so that together we can ring in 2018 safely.”
