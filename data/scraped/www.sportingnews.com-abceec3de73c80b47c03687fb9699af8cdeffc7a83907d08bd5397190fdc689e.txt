Isaiah Thomas' debut in the Cavaliers lineup is highly anticipated after the team has dropped three of its last four games.

The Cavaliers will be without Thomas for at least one more game as the team takes on the Jazz Sunday (AEDT), but their star player could play against the Blazers on Jan. 2.

Cavs coach Tyronn Lue gave some insight into some of the restrictions that Thomas, who has not played a game yet this season as he recovers from a hip injury, could face when he finally makes it back on the court for a game.

Lue said he will hold Thomas to playing only one leg of back-to-back games when he returns, according to ESPN. This means that if Thomas plays against Portland on Jan. 2, which is the earliest he could return, Thomas will automatically be out against the Celtics the next night. There is also the possibility that he will be on a minute restriction.

The former Celtics star would like to make it back for the Cavs' game against Boston, but he also indicated that it would be tough for him if he's not 100 percent.

"I don't want to play just to be out there, so, I don't know. ... That minute restriction, that would be tough to play in Boston on a minute restriction," Thomas said.
