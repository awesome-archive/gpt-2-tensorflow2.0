According to several sites, SEGA has inadvertently uploaded the entire Daytona Championship USA code online, and it appears that the modding community already has the game running on PC.

SEGA had apparently released a new update for the arcade game for vendors to download and apply to the game, but the patch actually contained the full game, according to MrThunderwing. As of now, modders haven’t yet been able to get the controls to work, but the menu system can be navigated with an Xbox 360 controller.

If this turns out to be true, and it certainly seems like it is, I can’t recall a time in recent memory when a video game company did something more stupid than leak its own game on the Internet.
